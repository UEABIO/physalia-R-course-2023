Foundations of programming in R: This session serves as an excellent starting point, covering the fundamentals of R programming. Introducing object classes, coding practices, control flow, and writing functions provides a solid foundation for the rest of the course.

Functional programming in R: Functional programming is an important concept, and it's great that you're dedicating a session to it. Covering loops, apply functions, and other functional programming principles will help participants write more efficient and concise code.

Getting the most out of tidyverse: Exploring the Tidyverse is a valuable part of any R course. Since Tidyverse is widely used for data manipulation and analysis, this session will provide participants with practical skills they can directly apply.

Figures and Tables: Data visualization is crucial, and dedicating a session to creating high-quality figures and tables is a great idea. Make sure to cover various visualization techniques and perhaps touch on packages like ggplot2 for advanced visualizations.

Working with Shiny: Shiny is a powerful tool for creating interactive web applications, and introducing it in the course is a good decision. Building Shiny dashboards aligns with the intermediate level and will give participants a practical project to work on.

Reports: Generating reports is an essential skill for data analysts and researchers. Covering reporting packages and customization will empower participants to present their findings effectively.

Github: Version control and collaboration are critical skills, especially in a professional environment. This session will equip participants with the basics of using Github, which is essential for teamwork and code management.
