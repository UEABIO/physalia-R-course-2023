# (PART\*) Get Started in R {.unnumbered}

# Introduction to R and RStudio

```{r, child='_setup.Rmd'}
```

-   R is the name of the programming language we will learn on this course.

-   RStudio is a convenient interface which we will be using throughout the course in order to learn how to organise data, produce accurate data analyses & data visualisations.

R is a programming language that you will write code in, and RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which makes working with R easier. Think of it as knowing English and using a plain text editor like NotePad to write a book versus using a word processor like Microsoft Word. You could do it, but it wouldn't look as good and it would be much harder without things like spell-checking and formatting. In a similar way, you can use R without R Studio but we wouldn't recommend it. The key thing to remember is that although you will do all of your work using RStudio for this course, you are actually using **two** pieces of software which means that from time-to-time, both of them may have separate updates.

R and RStudio can be downloaded for free onto your [personal computers](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)(see Appendices), but for convenience we will use a classroom space on **Posit cloud**.

[Posit cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) is a cloud-based service where we can log into remotely hosted servers that host our data analysis projects.

The advantage of using Posit cloud is that all the extra packages and functions you need for this course will already be installed. You can log-in to your workspace from any computer as long as you have an internet connection and remember you username and password. I can also "visit" your projects and help out when you get stuck, if they are hosted on Posit cloud.

Eventually we will may also add extra tools like GitHub and RMarkdown for data reproducibility, literate and collaborative programming.

By the end of this course I hope you will have the tools to confidently analyze real data, make informative and beautiful data visuals, and be able to analyze lots of different types of data.

## Using Posit cloud

All of our sessions will run on cloud-based software. All you have to do is make a free account, and join our Workspace.

Once you are signed up - you will see that there are two spaces:

-   Your workspace - for personal use (20hrs/month)

-   Our shared classroom - educational licence (no limit)

Make sure you are working in the classroom workspace - so that I can distribute project work and 'visit' your projects if needed.

Posit cloud works in exactly the same way as RStudio, but means you don't have to download any software. You can access the hosted cloud server and your projects through any browser connection (Chrome works best), from any computer.

Here is a good reference guide to [Posit cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/guide#projects)

## Getting to know RStudio

R Studio has a console that you can try out code in (appearing as the bottom left window), there is a script editor (top left), a window showing functions and objects you have created in the "Environment" tab (top right window in the figure), and a window that shows plots, files packages, and help documentation (bottom right).

```{r img-rstudio, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="RStudio interface"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio.png")

```

You will learn more about how to use the features included in R Studio throughout this course, however, I highly recommend watching [RStudio Essentials 1](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/programming-part-1-writing-code-in-rstudio/) at some point. 

The video lasts \~30 minutes and gives a tour of the main parts of R Studio.

### Consoles vs. scripts

* The *script* window is the place to enter and run code so that it is easily edited and saved for future use. Usually the Script Window is shown at the top left in RStudio. If this window is not shown, it will be visible *if* you open a previously saved R script, *or* if you create a new R Script. You create new R Script by clicking on File > New File > R Script in the RStudio menu bar.

* To execute your code in the R script, you can either highlight the code and click on Run, or you can highlight the code and press CTRL + Enter on your keyboard.

* The *console*: you can enter code directly in the Console Window and click Enter. The commands that you run will be shown in the History Window on the top right of RStudio. Though it is much more difficult to keep track of your work this way.

### Environment

The Environment tab (top right) allows you to see what objects are in the workspace. If you create variables or data frames, you have a visual listing of everything in the current workspace. When you start a new project this should be completely empty.

### Plots, files, packages, help

1. Plots - The Plots panel, shows all your plots. There are buttons for opening the plot in a separate window and exporting the plot as a pdf or jpeg (though you can also do this with code.)

2. Files - The files panel gives you access to the file directory on your hard drive. 

3. Packages - Shows a list of all the R packages installed on your harddrive and indicates whether or not they are currently loaded. Packages that are loaded in the current session are checked while those that are installed but not yet loaded are unchecked. We will discuss packages more later.

4. Help - Help menu for R functions. You can either type the name of a function in the search window, or use the code to search for a function with the name


```{r labelled, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="RStudio interface labelled"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/RStudio_Screenshot_Labels.png")

```

### Make RStudio your own

You can [personalise the RStudio GUI](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011846747-Using-Themes-in-the-RStudio-IDE) as much as you like. 

```{r themed, echo=FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%"}

knitr::include_graphics(c("images/dark_mode.png", "images/classic_mode.png"))

```


## Get Help!

There are a lot of sources of information about using R out there. Here are a few helpful places to get help when you have an issue, or just to learn more

-   The R help system itself - type `help()` and put the name of the package or function you are querying inside the brackets

-   Vignettes - type `browseVignettes()` into the console and hit Enter, a list of available vignettes for all the packages we have will be displayed

-   Cheat Sheets - available at [RStudio.com.](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) Most common packages have an associate cheat sheet covering the basics of how to use them. Download/bookmark ones we will use commonly such as ggplot2, data transformation with dplyr, Data tidying with tidyr & Data import.

-   Google - I use Google constantly, because I continually forget how to do even basic tasks. If I want to remind myself how to round a number, I might type something like R round number - if I am using a particular package I should include that in the search term as well

-   Ask for help - If you are stuck, getting an error message, can't think what to do next, then ask someone. It could be me, it could be a classmate. When you do this it is very important that you show the code, include the error message. "This doesn't work" is not helpful. "Here is my code, this is the data I am using, I want it to do X, and here's the problem I get."

```{block, type = "info"}
It may be daunting to send your code to someone for help. 


It is natural and common to feel apprehensive, or to think that your code is really bad. I still feel the same! But we learn when we share our mistakes, and eventually you will find it funny when you look back on your early mistakes, or laugh about the mistakes you still occasionally make!
```

# R basics

Go to Posit cloud and enter the Project labelled `Day One` - this will clone the project and provide you with your own project workspace.

Follow the instructions below to get used to the R command line, and how R works as a language.

## Your first R command

In the RStudio pane, navigate to the **console** (bottom left) and `type or copy` the below it should appear at the \>

Hit Enter on your keyboard.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
10 + 20

```

-   What answer did you get?

`r hide("Solution")`

```{r, eval = F, echo = T, results = 'asis'}
30
```

`r unhide()`

The first line shows the request you made to R, the next line is R's response

You didn't type the `>` symbol: that's just the R command prompt and isn't part of the actual command.

When a complete expression is entered at the prompt, it is evaluated and the result of the evaluated expression is returned. The result may be auto-printed.

```{r, eval = F}
print(10 + 20) ## explicit printing

10 + 20 ## autoprinting
```

Usually, with interactive work, we do not explicitly print objects with the print function; it is much easier to auto-print them by typing the name of the object and hitting return/enter. However, when writing scripts, functions, or more extended programs, there is sometimes a need to explicitly print objects.


When an R vector is printed, you will notice that an index for the vector is printed in square brackets `[]` on the side. For example, see this integer sequence 

```{r}
1:30
```

The numbers in the square brackets are not part of the vector itself; they are merely part of the printed output.

> Note that the : operator is used to create integer sequences

### Operators

There are a few different types of operators to consider in R

#### Assignment Operator

|Operator|Description
|-----|-----|
|<-|	used to assign values to variables|

#### Arithmetic Operators

|Operator|Description
|-----|-----|
|+|	addition|
|-|	subtraction|
|*|	multiplication|
|/|	division|
|^|	exponentiation|

#### Relational Operators

|Operator|Description
|-----|-----|
|<|less than|
|<=|less than or equal to|
|>|	greater than|
|>=|greater than or equal to|
|==|exactly equal to|
|!=|not equal to|

#### Logical Operators

|Operator|Description
|-----|-----|
|!|not|
|&|AND|
|⎮|  OR|

#### Membership Operators

|Operator|Description
|-----|-----|
|%in%|used to check if an element is in a vector or list|

### Typos

```{block, type = "warning"}

Before we go on to talk about other types of calculations that we can do with R, there's a few other things I want to point out. The first thing is that, while R is good software, it's still software. It's pretty stupid, and because it's stupid it can't handle typos. It takes it on faith that you meant to type exactly what you did type.

```

Suppose you forget to hit the shift key when trying to type `+`, and as a result your command ended up being `10 = 20` rather than `10 + 20`. Try it for yourself and replicate this error message:

```{r eval=FALSE}
10 = 20
```

`r hide("What answer did you get?")`
```{r, eval = T, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
cat("Error in 10 = 20 : invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment")
```

`r unhide()`

What's going on: R tries to interpret `10 = 20` as a command, but it doesn't make sense, so it gives you an error message.

When a person sees this, they might realize it's a typo because the `+` and `=` keys are right next to each other on the keyboard. But R doesn't have that insight, so it just gets confused.

What's even trickier is that some typos won't create errors because they accidentally form valid R commands. For example, if I meant to type `10 + 20` but mistakenly pressed a neighboring key, I'd end up with `10 - 20`. Now, R can't read your mind to know you wanted to add, not subtract, so something different happens:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
10 - 20
```

In this case, R produces the right answer, but to the the wrong question.

### More simple arithmetic

One of the best ways to get familiar with R is to experiment with it. The good news is that it's quite hard to mess things up, so don't stress too much. Just type whatever you like into the console and see what happens.

Now, if your console's last line looks like this:

    > 10+
    + 

And there's a *blinking cursor* next to that plus sign, it means R is patiently waiting for you to complete your command. It believes you're still typing, so it hasn't tried to run anything yet. This plus sign is a bit different from the usual prompt (the `>` symbol). It's there to nudge you that R is ready to "add" what you're typing now to what you typed before. For example, type `20` and hit enter, and then R will complete the command like this:

    > 10 +
    + 20
    [1] 30

*Alternatively* hit the escape key, and R will forget what you were trying to do and return to a blank line.

### Try some simple maths

```{r, eval = FALSE}
1+7
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
13-10
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
4*6
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
12/3
```

Raise a number to the power of another

```{r, eval = FALSE}
5^4
```

Multiplying a number $x$ by itself $n$ times is called "raising $x$ to the $n$-th power". Mathematically, this is written as $x^n$. Some values of $n$ have special names: in particular $x^2$ is called $x$-squared, and $x^3$ is called $x$-cubed. So, the 4th power of 5 is calculated like this: 

$$5^4 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 $$

### Perform some combos

R follows the standard order of operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS), which means it first calculates within brackets, then deals with exponents, followed by division and multiplication, and finally addition and subtraction.

Let's look at two examples to see how the order of operations affects the results:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
3^2-5/2
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
(3^2-5)/2
```

Similarly if we want to raise a number to a fraction, we need to surround the fraction with parentheses `()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
16^1/2
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
16^(1/2)
```

The first one calculates 16 raised to the power of 1, then divided this answer by two. The second one raises 16 to the power of a half. A big difference in the output.

```{block, type = "info"}
While the cursor is in the console, you can press the up arrow to see all your previous commands. 


You can run them again, or edit them. Later on we will look at scripts, as an essential way to re-use, store and edit commands. 
```

## "TRUE or FALSE" data

Time to make a sidebar onto another kind of data. Many concepts in programming rely on the idea of a ***logical value***. A logical value is an assertion about whether something is true or false. This is implemented in R in a pretty straightforward way. There are two logical values, namely `TRUE` and `FALSE`. Despite the simplicity, logical values are very useful things. Let's see how they work.

### Assessing mathematical truths

Time to explore a different kind of data. In programming, many concepts rely on logical values. A logical value is a statement about whether something is true or false. In R, this is pretty straightforward. There are two logical values: `TRUE` and `FALSE`. Despite their simplicity, these logical values are incredibly useful. Let's dive into how they work.

In R, basic mathematics is solid, and there's no room for manipulation. When you ask R to calculate `2 + 2`, it always provides the same answer,

```{r}
2 + 2
```

up to this point, R has been performing calculations without explicitly asserting whether $2 + 2 = 4$ is a true statement. If I want R to make an explicit judgment, I can use a command like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
2 + 2 == 4
```

`r hide("Solution")`
```{r, eval = T, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
cat("TRUE")
```

`r unhide()`

What I've done here is use the ***equality operator***, `==`, to force R to make a "true or false" judgement.

```{block, type = "warning"}
This is a very different operator to the assignment operator `=` you saw previously. 

A common typo that people make when trying to write logical commands in R (or other languages, since the "`=` versus `==`" distinction is important in most programming languages) is to accidentally type `=` when you really mean `==`.
```

Okay, let's see what R thinks of `2 +2 ==5`:

```{r}
2+2 == 5

```

Now, let's see what happens when I attempt to make R believe that two plus two equals five by using an assignment statement like `2 + 2 = 5` or `2 + 2 <- 5`. Here's the outcome:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
2 + 2 = 5
```

    Error in 2 + 2 = 5 : target of assignment expands to non-language object

Indeed, R isn't too fond of this idea. It quickly realizes that `2 + 2` is not a variable (that's what the "non-language object" part is saying), and it refuses to let you "reassign" it. While R can be quite flexible and allows you to do some remarkable things to redefine parts of itself, there are fundamental truths it simply won't budge on. It won't tamper with the laws of addition, and it won't redefine the number `2`.

That's probably for the best.

## Storing outputs

When dealing with more complex questions, it's often helpful to store our answers and use them in later steps. Fortunately, this is quite easy to do in R. We can assign the results to a name with the **assignment operator**:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
a <- 1+2

```

This literally means please *assign* the value of `1+2` to the name `a`. We use the **assignment operator** `<-` to make this assignment.

```{block, type = "info"}
Note the shortcut key for <- is Alt + - (Windows) or Option + - (Mac)
```


By performing this action, you'll achieve two things:

You will notice in the top right-hand pane within the **Environment** tab that there is now an **object** labeled a with a value of `3`.

```{r img-environment, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="object a is now visible withe a value of 3 in the Environment Pane"}

    knitr::include_graphics("images/environment.png")
```

- You can check what the variable a contains by typing it into your Console and pressing Enter.

- Keep in mind that you won't see the result of your operations until you type the object into the R console and press Enter.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
a  ## autoprinting

print(a) ## explicit printing
```

`r hide("What output do you get when you type a into your console?")`
```{r, eval = F, echo = T, results = 'asis'}
3
```

`r unhide()`

You can now call this object at *any time* during your R session and perform calculations with it.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
2 * a
```

`r hide("Solution")`
```{r, eval = F, echo = T, results = 'asis'}
6
```

`r unhide()`


What happens if we assign a value to a named object that **already** exists in our R environment??? for example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
a <- 10
a
```

The value of `a` is now 10.

You should see that the previous assignment is lost, *gone forever* and has been replaced by the new value.

We can assign lots of things to objects, and use them in calculations to build more objects.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
b <- 5
c <- a + b
```

```{block, type = "warning"}
Remember: If you now change the value of b, the value of c does *not* change. 


Objects are totally **independent** from each other once they are made.


Overwriting objects with new values means the old value is lost.

```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
b <- 7
b
c
```

-   What is the value of `c`?

`r hide("What is the value of c ?")`
```{r, eval = T, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
15
```

When `c` was created it was a product of `a` and `b` having values of 10 and 15 respectively. 
If we re-ran the command `c <- a + b` *after* changing the value of `b` **then** we would get a value of 17. 

`r unhide()`

Look at the environment tab again - you should see it's starting to fill up now!

```{block, type = "info"}

RStudio will by default save the objects in its memory when you close a session. 


These will then be there the next time you logon. It might seem nice to be able to close things down and pick up where you left off, but its actually quite dangerous. It's messy, and can cause lots of problems when we work with scripts later, so don't do this! 


To stop RStudio from saving objects by default go to Tools > Project Options option and change "Save workspace to .RData on exit" to "No" or "Never".


Instead we are going to learn how to use scripts to quickly re-run analyses we have been working on. 

```

### Choosing names

-   Use informative variable names. As a general rule, using meaningful names like `orange` and `apple` is preferred over arbitrary ones like `variable1` and `variable2`. Otherwise it's very hard to remember what the contents of different variables actually are.

-   Use short variable names. Typing is a pain and no-one likes doing it. So we much prefer to use a name like `apple` over a name like `pink_lady_apple`.

-   Use one of the conventional naming styles for multi-word variable names. R only lets you use certain things as **legal** names. Legal names must start with a letter **not** a number, which can then be followed by a sequence of letters, numbers, ., or \_. R does not like using spaces. Upper and lower case names are allowed, but R is case sensitive so `Apple` and `apple` are different.

-   My favourite naming convention is `snake_case` short, lower case only, spaces between words are separated with a \_. It's easy to read and easy to remember.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.alt= "snake_case", fig.cap="courtesy of Allison Horst"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/snake_case.png")
```

## R objects

In R, there are five fundamental or "atomic" classes of objects:

- Character: These represent text or character strings.

- Numeric (num) or Double (dbl): These are used for real numbers (e.g., decimal numbers).

- Integer: Used for whole numbers.

- Complex: For complex numbers.

- Logical: Represented as True or False, these are used for logical values.

The most basic type of R object is a vector. You can create empty vectors using the `vector()` function. The primary rule regarding vectors in R is that a vector can only contain objects of the same class.

However, as with any good rule, there's an exception, which is the "list." Lists are represented as vectors but can hold objects of different classes, which is why they're often used.

### Numbers

In R, both "dbl" and "num" refer to numeric data types, but there is a subtle difference between them:

- dbl ("double"): This refers to double-precision floating-point numbers, which are capable of storing real numbers with high precision. Double-precision numbers have more decimal places of accuracy and can represent a wider range of values without loss of precision. When you perform arithmetic operations, R typically returns results as "dbl" values by default.

- num ("numeric"): "Num" is a more general term that includes not only double-precision floating-point numbers but also integer values. In R, integers are a subtype of numeric data. Numeric data can include both integers and double-precision floating-point numbers, depending on the specific data and how it is represented.

So, "dbl" specifically denotes double-precision floating-point numbers, while "num" encompasses a broader range of numeric data, including both integers and double-precision numbers. In most cases, you can use "num" to work with numeric data in a more general sense, while "dbl" focuses on the higher-precision representation of real numbers.


## Attributes

R objects can come with attributes, which are essentially metadata for the object. These metadata are handy because they help describe the object. For instance, in a data frame, column names serve as attributes, clarifying the data contained in each column. Here are a few examples of R object attributes:

- `names()` and `dimnames()`

- dimensions (e.g., for matrices and arrays) `dim()`

- `class()` (e.g., integer, numeric)

- `length()`

- Other user-defined attributes or metadata

You can access the attributes of an object, if it has any, by using the `attributes()` function. If an R object doesn't have any attributes, the `attributes()` function will return NULL.

## Vectors

We have been working with R objects containing a single element of data (the technical term is **scalar**), but we will more commonly work with vectors. A vector is a sequence of elements, all of the same data type. These could be logical, numerical, character etc.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

numeric_vector <- c(1,2,3)

character_vector <- c("fruits", "vegetables", "seeds")

logical_vector <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)

integer_vector <- 1:10

```

### Coercion

In R, when different classes of objects are mixed together in a vector, coercion occurs to ensure that every element in the vector belongs to the same class. Coercion is the process of converting objects to a common class to make the combination reasonable. Let's see the effects of implicit coercion in the provided examples:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

y <- c(2.3, "a") # Here, we're mixing a numeric value (1.7) with a character value ("a"). To make them compatible, R coerces both elements into character values. So, y becomes a character vector.

y <- c(TRUE, 2) # In this case, we're combining a logical value (TRUE) with a numeric value (2). R coerces the logical value into 1, so y becomes a numeric vector.

y <- c("a", TRUE) # We're mixing a character value ("a") with a logical value (TRUE). In this scenario, R coerces the logical value into a character value, resulting in y becoming a character vector.

```

So, the outcome depends on how R can reasonably represent all the objects in the vector. It aims to create a vector of the most inclusive class to accommodate the mixed objects. Keep in mind that this coercion can lead to unexpected results, so it's essential to be aware of the implicit type conversion when mixing different data types in R.

Objects can also be **explicitly coerced** from one class to another using the as.* functions, if available.

```{task}
Create the following vector and check its class, then note what happens when you attempt to coerce to numeric, logical and character
``{r}
x <- 0:5
``

```

```{solution}

``{r}
as.numeric(x)

as.logical(x)

as.character(x)


``


```

Sometimes, R can’t figure out how to coerce an object and this can result in `NA`s being produced

### Subsetting vectors

With numerical indexing, you enter a vector of integers corresponding to the values in the vector you want to access in the form a[index], where a is the vector, and index is a vector of index values. For example, let’s use numerical indexing to get values from our character_vector

```{r, eval = F}

character_vector[2]
# [1] "vegetables"


character_vector[1:2]
# [1] "fruits"     "vegetables"

character_vector[c(1,3)]
# [1] "fruits" "seeds" 

```

We can also use logical indexing

```{r, eval = F}

numeric_vector <=2
# [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE

character_vector == "fruits"
#[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE
```

### Operations on vectors

We can run the same basic operations on vectors as we did on scalars

```{r}

x <- c(1,2,3)
y <- c(2,3,4)

# Operations will happen between vectors
x*y

```

A very *super-wickedly*, **important**, concept: R likes to operate on vectors of the same length, so if it encounters two vectors of different lengths in a binary operation, it merely replicates (recycles) the smaller vector until it is the same length as the longest vector, then it does the operation.

```{r, eval = F}

x <- c(1,2,3)
y <- c(1,2)

# Operations will happen between vectors
x*y

```
```
[1] 1 4 3

Warning: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length[1] 1 4 3

```

## Matrices

Matrices can be thought of as vectors with an added dimension attribute. This dimension attribute is a two-element integer vector specifying the number of rows and columns, which defines the shape and structure of the matrix.

```{block, type = "info"}
Data frames are also two-dimensional but can store columns of different data types - matrices are simpler as they consist of elements of the same data type.
```

Matrices are constructed "columns-first" so entries start in the "upper left" and and run down columns. 

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3) 
m
```

```{r}
attributes(m)
```

We can create matrices in several ways:

- Adding a `dim()` to existing vectors

- Column/row-binding vectors with `cbind()` and `rbind()`

```{r}
m <- 1:6

dim(m) <- c(2,3)

m

```

```{r}
a <- 1:2
b <- 3:4
c <- 5:6

m <- cbind(a,b,c)
m
```

You will see how in this last operation column names were added to the matrix, we can add, change or remove column and rownames on a matrix with `colnames()` and `rownames()`

```{r}
rownames(m) <- c("y","z")
m
```

## Lists

Lists are a versatile and fundamental data type in R. They set themselves apart from regular vectors by allowing you to store elements of different classes within the same list. This flexibility is what makes lists so powerful for various data structures and data manipulation tasks.

You can create lists explicitly using the `list()` function, which can take an arbitrary number of arguments. Lists, when combined with functions like the "apply" family, enable you to perform complex and versatile data manipulations and analyses in R. Lists are often used to represent heterogeneous data structures, such as datasets where different columns can have different data types and structures.

```{r}

l <- list(1, "apple", TRUE )
l
```

We can also create empty lists of set lengths with the `vector()` function, this can be useful for preallocating memory for iterations - as we will see later

```{r}
l <- vector("list", length = 3)
l
```

Lists can also have names

```{r}
names(l) <- c("apple","orange","pear")

```

## Dataframes

Data frames are essential for storing tabular data in R and find extensive use in various statistical modeling and data analysis applications. They offer a structured way to manage and work with data in R, and packages like dplyr, developed by Hadley Wickham, provide optimized functions for efficient data manipulation with data frames.

Here are some key characteristics and advantages of data frames:

- Tabular Structure: Data frames are a type of list, where each element in the list represents a column. The number of rows in each column is the same, and this tabular structure makes them suitable for working with datasets.

- Mixed Data Types: Unlike matrices, data frames can contain columns with different classes of objects. This flexibility allows you to handle real-world datasets that often include variables of different data types.

- Column and Row Names: Data frames include column names, which describe the variables or predictors. Additionally, they have a special attribute called "row.names" that provides information about each row in the data frame.

- Creation and Conversion: Data frames can be created in various ways, such as reading data from files using functions like read.table() and read.csv(). You can also create data frames explicitly with data.frame().

- Working with Data: Data frames are especially useful when working with datasets that require data cleaning, transformation, or merging. They provide a high level of data organization, and many R packages are designed to work seamlessly with data frames.

- dplyr: The `dplyr` package is optimized for efficient data manipulation with data frames. It offers a set of functions to perform data operations quickly and intuitively.

Data frames are a fundamental structure for managing tabular data in R. They excel in handling datasets with mixed data types and are essential for various data analysis and modeling tasks.

To create a dataframe from vectors we use the `data.frame()` function

```{r}
survey <- data.frame("index" = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
                     "sex" = c("m", "m", "m", "f", "f"),
                     "age" = c(99, 46, 23, 54, 23))

```

There is one key argument to `data.frame()` and similar functions called `stringsAsFactors`. By default, the data.frame() function will automatically convert any string columns to a specific type of object called a factor in R. A factor is a nominal variable that has a well-specified possible set of values that it can take on. For example, one can create a factor sex that can only take on the values "male" and "female".

```{block, type = "warning"}

Since R ver 4.0 release, stringsAsFactors is set FALSE by default!

```

However, as I’m sure you’ll discover, having R automatically convert your string data to factors can lead to lots of strange results. For example: if you have a factor of sex data, but then you want to add a new value called other, R will yell at you and return an error. I hate, hate, HATE when this happens. While there are very, very rare cases when I find factors useful, I almost always don’t want or need them. For this reason, I avoid them at all costs.

To tell R to not convert your string columns to factors, you need to include the argument `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` when using functions such as `data.frame()`

```{r}
str(survey)
```

To access a specific column in a dataframe by name, you use the `$` operator in the form `df$name` where `df` is the name of the dataframe, and name is the name of the column you are interested in. This operation will then return the column you want as a vector.

```{r}

survey$sex

```

Because the `$` operator returns a vector, you can easily calculate descriptive statistics on columns of a dataframe by applying your favorite vector function (like `mean()`). 

```{r}

mean(survey$age)

```

We can also use the `$` to add new vectors to a dataframe

```{r}

survey$follow_up <- c(T,F,T,F,F)
survey

```

Changing column names is easy with a combination of `names()` and indexing

```{r}

names(survey)[1] <- "ID"

survey

```

### Slice dataframes

Matrices and dataframes can be sliced with `[,]`

```
# Return row 1
df[1, ]


# Return column 5 as vector
df[, 5]

# Return column as data.frame
df[5]

# Rows 1:5 and column 2
df[1:5, 2]

# Single element
df[[1,2]]

```

Or slice with `subset`

```{r}
survey_slice <- subset(x = survey,
      subset = age < 50 &
               sex == "m")

survey_slice
```

### Tibbles

“Tibbles” are a new modern data frame. It keeps many important features of the original data frame

- A tibble never changes the input type.

- A tibble can have columns that are lists.

- A tibble can have non-standard variable names.
    - can start with a number or contain spaces.
    -to use this refer to these in a backtick.
    
- Tibbles only print the first 10 rows and all the columns that fit on a screen. - Each column displays its data type

The way we make tibbles is very similar to making dataframes

```{r}
survey_tibble <- tibble("index" = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
                     "sex" = c("m", "m", "m", "f", "f"),
                     "age" = c(99, 46, 23, 54, 23))

```


```{r, eval = F}
# Some R functions for looking at tibbles and dataframes

head(survey_tibble, n=2)
tail(survey_tibble, n=1)
nrow(survey_tibble)
ncol(survey_tibble)
colnames(survey_tibble)
view(survey_tibble)
glimpse(survey_tibble)
str(survey_tibble)

```

### Brackets with tibbles

The behaviour of single [] indexing with tibbles is slightly different. 

In a dataframe [,1] extracts a single column as a vector, but with a tibble this conversion does not occur. Instead it returns as a tibble with a single column, not a vector.

To extract a vector we must use:

```{r, eval = F}
# pull function
pull(survey_tibble, sex)

# double brackets
survey_tibble[[2]]

```

## Functions

Functions are the tools of R. Each one helps us to do a different task.

Take for example the function that we use to round a number to a certain number of digits - this function is called `round`

Here's an example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
round(x  = 2.4326782647, digits = 2)
```

We start the command with the function name `round`. The name is followed by parentheses `()`. Within these we place the *arguments* for the function, each of which is separated by a comma.

The arguments:

-   `x =` 2.4326782647 (the number we would like to round)

-   `digits =` 2 (the number of decimal places we would like to round to)

**Arguments are the inputs we give to a function**. These arguments are in the form `name = value` the name specifies the argument, and the value is what we are providing to define the input. That is the first argument `x` is the number we would like to round, it has a value of 2.4326782647. The second argument `digits` is how we would like the number to be rounded and we specify 2. There is no limit to how many arguments a function *could* have.


```{block, type = "try"}
Copy and paste the following code into the console. 
```


```{r help-doc, eval=FALSE}

help(round)

```

The help documentation for `round()`should appear in the bottom right help panel. In the usage section, we see that `round()`takes the following form:

```{r arguments, eval = FALSE}

round(x, digits = 0)

```

In the arguments section, there are explanations for each of the arguments. `x`is the number or vector where we wish to round values. `digits` is the number of decimal places to be used. In the description we can see that if no value is supplied for `digits` it will default to 0 or whole number rounding.

Read the 'Details' section to find out what happens when rounding when the last digit is a 5.

Let's try an example and just change the required argument `digits`

```{block, type = "try"}
Copy and paste the following code into the console. 
```

```{r setseed}

round(x  = 2.4326782647)

```

Now we can change the additional arguments to produce a different set of numbers.

```{r}
round(x  = 2.4326782647, digits = 2)

```

This time R has still rounded the number, but it has done so to a set number of 'decimal places'.

Always remember to use the help documentation to help you understand what arguments a function requires.

### Storing the output of functions

What if we need the answer from a function in a later calculation. The answer is to use the assignment operator again `<-`.

In this example we assign values to two R objects that we can then call inside our R function **as though we were putting numbers in directly**.

```{block, type = "try"}
Copy and paste the following code into the console. 
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}

number_of_digits <- 3

my_number <- 2.4326782647

rounded_number <- round(x  = my_number, 
                        digits = number_of_digits)

```

**What value is assigned to the R object `rounded_number`** **?**

`r hide("Solution")`

```{r, eval = T, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
2.433
```

`r unhide()`

### More fun with functions

Copy and paste this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
round(2.4326782647, 2)
```

Looks like we don't even *have* to give the names of arguments for a function to still work. This works because the function `round` expects us to give the number value first, and the argument for rounding digits second. *But* this assumes we know the expected ordering within a function, this might be the case for functions we use a lot. If you give arguments their proper names *then* you can actually introduce them in **any order you want**.

Try this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
round(digits = 2, x  = 2.4326782647)
```

But this gives a different answer

```{r, eval = FALSE}
round(2, 2.4326782647)
```

```{block, type = "warning"}

Remember naming arguments overrides the position defaults
```

How do we **know** the argument orders and defaults? Well we get to know how a lot of functions work through practice, but we can also use `help()` .

## Packages

When you install R you will have access to a range of functions including options for data wrangling and statistical analysis. The functions that are included in the default installation are typically referred to as **Base R** and there is a useful cheat sheet that shows many Base R functions [here](%5Bhttps://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/base-r.pdf)

However, the power of R is that it is extendable and open source - anyone can create a new **package** that extends the functions of R.

An R package is a container for various things including functions and data. These make it easy to do very complicated protocols by using custom-built functions. Later we will see how we can write our own simple functions. Packages are a lot like new apps extending the functionality of what your phone can do.


### Loading packages

To use the functions from a package in our script they must be loaded *before* we call on the functions or data they contain. So the most sensible place to put library calls for packages is at the very **top** of our script.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

library(package_name)

```

### Calling Functions from Packages

After loading a package, you can call its functions using either `function()` or the full `package_name::function_name()` syntax. This allows you to specify the package explicitly when using a particular function.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

library(dplyr)

filter(dataframe, condition)

dplyr::filter(dataframe, conditions)

```

Calling a function explicitly via its package can be useful for 

1. Avoiding Conflicts:

Sometimes, multiple packages may have functions with the same name. By explicitly specifying the package with package_name::, you avoid naming conflicts and ensure that R uses the function from the intended package.

2. Clarity:

It can make your code more transparent and easier to understand, especially in cases where the function's origin is not immediately obvious. This is helpful for both yourself and others who read your code.

>Though it is still good practice to comment at the top of your script that this package is required even if you don't include library(package)


3. Debugging:

When troubleshooting issues or debugging code, specifying the package source of a function can help pinpoint problems and ensure that the correct function is being used.

## Error

Things will go wrong eventually, they always do...

R is *very* pedantic, even the smallest typo can result in failure and typos are impossilbe to avoid. So we will make mistakes. One type of mistake we will make is an **error**. The code fails to run. The most common causes for an error are:

-   typos

-   missing commas

-   missing brackets

There's nothing wrong with making *lots* of errors. The trick is not to panic or get frustrated, but to read the error message and our script carefully and start to *debug* (more on this later)...

... and sometimes we need to walk away and come back later!

```{block, type = "try"}
Try typing the command `help()` into the R console, it should open a new tab on the bottom right. 


Put a function or package into the brackets to get help with a specific topic 
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.alt= "R Error", fig.cap="courtesy of Allison Horst"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Error.jpg")
```
