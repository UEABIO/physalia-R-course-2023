## Structuring a function

R makes it easy to create user defined functions by using `function()`. Here is how it works:


```r
# this is an example function
my_function_name <- function(my_args) {
  # document your function here
  # what the function does
  # function inputs and outputs
  some_calculated_output <- (argument1 + argument2 )
  
  return(some_calculated_output)
}
```

* Give your function an object name and assign the function to it, e.g. `my_function_name <- function()`.

* Within the parentheses you specify inputs and arguments just like how pre-written functions work, e.g. `function(my_args)`.

* Next, put all the code you want your function to execute inside curly brackets like this: `function(my_args) {code to run}`

* Use `return()` to specify what you want to your function to output once it is done running the code.


### Activity: Understand the function

Here is a very simple function. Can you guess what it does?


```r
add_one <- function(x) {
  return(x + 1)
}
```



```r
add_one(10)
```

```
## [1] 11
```

What value did you get when running the function above? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='2' data-answer='["11"]'/>

Now try applying your function to this vector:


```r
number_series <- c(1,5,10)
```

You should see it worked on *each element* inside the vector. This emphasises that R is a vector based language (it will by default apply functions on all elements in an object). 

## Function environments

When a function is evaluated, it creates it's own environment. All of the arguments that are passed to the function,
along with any variables created in the function are stored in this new environment.

The function's environment's parent will be the global environment, so we can see all of the variables created in the
global environment. Variables that are created in the function's environment aren't visible from the global environment
though.

If we reassign a variable in a function it will take a copy of that variable rather than mutating the value in the global environment. If we want to update `x` in the global environment we need to use the `<<-` operator.


```r
# x has a value of 1 in the global environment
x <- 1 

fn <- function(y) {
 # the value of x is copied from the global environment
 # but any changes remain only within the function environment
  x <- x * 2
  z <- x + y
  return(z)
}

fn(2)
x
```

```
## [1] 4
## [1] 1
```
<div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"> Task </div><div class="panel-body"> 
create a function called `fahr_to_kelvin` that converts temperature values from degrees Fahrenheit to Kelvin.

The conversion is `temp_in_kelvin <- (temp_fahr - 32) * (5 / 9)) + 273.15`
 </div></div>

<button id="displayTextunnamed-chunk-8" onclick="javascript:toggle('unnamed-chunk-8');">Show Solution</button>

<div id="toggleTextunnamed-chunk-8" style="display: none"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading panel-heading1"> Solution </div><div class="panel-body">

```r
fahr_to_kelvin <- function(fahr) {
  # function that converts temperature in degrees Fahrenheit to kelvin
  # input: fahr: numeric value representing temp in degrees farh
  # output: kelvin: numeric converted temp in kelvin
  kelvin <- ((fahr - 32) * (5 / 9)) + 273.15
  return(kelvin)
}
```
</div></div></div>

The `return()` function can return only a single object. If we want to return multiple values in R, we can use a `list` (or other objects) and return it.

<div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"> Task </div><div class="panel-body"> 

To convert temperature to Celsius from kelvin, you subtract 273.15 from the temperature value in kelvin. 
Write a function that performs this conversion and returns "both" kelvin and celsius.

<div id="toggleTextunnamed-chunk-10" style="display: none"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading panel-heading1"> Solution </div><div class="panel-body">

  celsius <- ((fahr - 32) * (5 / 9))
  kelvin <- celsius +  + 273.15
  
  temps <- list(celsius, kelvin)
  names(temps) <- c("celsius", "kelvin")
  
  return(temps)
}
```
</div></div></div>

<div class="info">
<p>A general rule of thumb. If you end up repeating a line of code more
than three times in a script - you should write a function to do the
work instead. And write clear comments on its use!</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It reduces the numbers of lines of code in your script, it reduces
the amount of repetition in the code, if you need to make changes you
can change the function without having to hunt through all of your
code.</p>
<p>A really good way to organise your functions is to organise them into
a separate script to the rest of your analysis. Write functions in a
separate script and use source(“scripts/functions.R”)</p>
</div>

### Argument defaults

This is an example of a very simple function that just prints the string "Hello World" whenever you type the function `say_hello()`


```r
say_hello <- function(){
  paste("Hello World") 
}

say_hello()
```

```
## [1] "Hello World"
```

### Activity: Understanding arguments

<div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"> Task </div><div class="panel-body"> 
What happens when you try to put something in the brackets when **using** this function?
  
e.g. say_hello("Phil")
 </div></div>

<button id="displayTextunnamed-chunk-14" onclick="javascript:toggle('unnamed-chunk-14');">Show Solution</button>

<div id="toggleTextunnamed-chunk-14" style="display: none"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading panel-heading1"> Solution </div><div class="panel-body">
Error in say_hello( or something similar, this function has not been set with any arguments, therefore it doesn't know what to do with any values provided to it. </div></div></div>

Now lets try a similar function, but we include an argument:


```r
say_morning <- function(x){
  paste("Good morning", x)
}

#  what about this one?
say_morning("Phil")
```

```
## [1] "Good morning Phil"
```

<div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"> Task </div><div class="panel-body"> 
What happens when you DO NOT put something in the brackets when using this function? </div></div>

<button id="displayTextunnamed-chunk-17" onclick="javascript:toggle('unnamed-chunk-17');">Show Solution</button>

<div id="toggleTextunnamed-chunk-17" style="display: none"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading panel-heading1"> Solution </div><div class="panel-body">

```r
Error in paste("Good morning", x) : 
  argument "x" is missing, with no default
```
</div></div></div>

So that was an example where we included an argument for our function. But now it requires a value be provided in order to work. 

#### Argument defaults

However, you are probably used to the idea that many functions have "default" values for arguments, and we can easily set these.


```r
say_morning_default <- function(name = "you"){
  paste("Good morning", name)
}

say_morning_default()
```

```
## [1] "Good morning you"
```

<div class="try">
<p>There is now a default value supplied to the argument, but this
should still be able to changed when running the function. Try it!</p>
</div>

## Checking functions

Pure Functions:
A pure function is a concept in programming that describes a function with the following characteristics:

It always produces the same output for the same input.
It has no side effects, meaning it doesn't modify external state or variables.
It relies only on its input parameters to generate output.
In R, pure functions are essential for creating clean and predictable code. They are often used in functional programming to perform operations on data without causing unexpected side effects.

Mathematical Functions:
Mathematical functions are a specific type of pure function that perform mathematical operations on their input parameters. Examples of mathematical functions in R include sqrt(), log(), sin(), and cos(). These functions take one or more arguments and return a result based solely on those arguments, making them referentially transparent.

Referential Transparency:
Referential transparency is a property of pure functions and mathematical functions where the output of a function depends solely on its input, and there are no side effects. In other words, when you call a referentially transparent function with the same input, you will always get the same output. This property makes code easier to understand, test, and reason about.

In R, many built-in functions and packages adhere to referential transparency, making them reliable and predictable for data manipulation and analysis tasks.




```r
library(testthat)

triangle_number <- function(x) {
    0.5 * x * (x + 1)
}
test_that("it works as expected", {
    expect_equal(triangle_number(1),  1)  
    expect_equal(triangle_number(2),  3)  
    expect_equal(triangle_number(3),  6)  
    expect_equal(triangle_number(4), 10)  
    expect_equal(triangle_number(5), 15)  
})
```


```r
test_that("it works as expected", {
    expect_equal(fahr_to_kelvin(92), 306.483, tolerance=1e-2)  
   
})
```


# Flow control

https://modern-rstats.eu/defining-your-own-functions.html#control-flow

https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/control-structures.html

Imagine you want a variable to be equal to a certain value if a condition is met. This is a typical problem that requires the `if` and `else` construct. For instance:


```r
a <- 4
b <- 5
```



```r
if (a > b) {
  f <- 20
    } else {
  f <- 10
}

f
```

```
## [1] 10
```

Another way to achieve this is by using the `ifelse()` function:


```r
f <- ifelse(a > b, 20, 10)
f
```

```
## [1] 10
```

`if` and `else` might seem interchangeable with `ifelse()`, but they’re not. `ifelse()` is vectorized. Let’s try the following:


```r
ifelse(c(1,2,4) > c(3, 1, 0), "yes", "no")
```

```
## [1] "no"  "yes" "yes"
```
Trying to attempt the same with `if` and `else` will result in an error as only the first element can be evaluated


```r
if (c(1, 2, 4) > c(3, 1, 0)) print("yes") else print("no")
```

```
Error in if (c(1, 2, 4) > c(3, 1, 0)) print("yes") else print("no") : 
  the condition has length > 1

```

The work around for this would to be use a loop, so that each element along the vector can be evaluated in turn. We will revisit loops shortly. 


```r
vector1 <- c(1, 2, 4)
vector2 <- c(3, 1, 0)

result <- character(length(vector1))  # Create an empty character vector to store the results

for (i in 1:length(vector1)) {
  if (vector1[i] > vector2[i]) {
    result[i] <- "yes"
  } else {
    result[i] <- "no"
  }
}

print(result)
```

```
## [1] "no"  "yes" "yes"
```
### `case_when`

`case_when` is a powerful `tidyverse` function in R that serves as an extension of `if_else`, providing a flexible way to create conditional transformations on multiple values within a dataset. While `if_else` is primarily used for a single condition, `case_when` is designed to handle multiple conditions and allows you to assign specific values or perform operations based on these conditions.

Here's a simple introduction to case_when as an extension of `if_else`:

Imagine you have a dataset with a column called "temperature," and you want to create a new column called "weather" based on different temperature ranges. With if_else, you might write something like this:


```r
temperature <-  c(10, 25, 5, 30, 15)

ifelse(temperature < 10, "Cold",
        ifelse(temperature >= 10 & temperature < 25, "Moderate", "Hot"))
```

```
## [1] "Moderate" "Hot"      "Cold"     "Hot"      "Moderate"
```


```r
case_when(
    temperature < 10 ~ "Cold",
    temperature >= 10 & temperature < 25 ~ "Moderate",
    temperature >= 25 ~ "Hot"
  )
```

```
## [1] "Moderate" "Hot"      "Cold"     "Hot"      "Moderate"
```

## Conditional functions

Let's make a function that reports p-values in APA format (with "p = [rounded value]" when p >= .001 and "p < .001" when p < .001).

You can add a default value to any argument. If that argument is skipped, then the function uses the default argument.

First we could make a function that rounds any value to three digits.


```r
report_p <- function(p, digits = 3) {
      roundp <- round(p, digits)
    reported <-  paste("p =", roundp)
    
    return(reported)
}
```

But we would like this to have a conditional response as well: so we need an `if` `else` statement.


```r
 report_p <- function(p, digits = 3) {
     reported <- if(p < 0.001){
             "p < 0.001"} else{
             paste("p =", round(p, digits))}
             
     
     return(reported)
 }
```

However we soon hit our first problem, this function works well when provided a single numeric value, but when applied to a vector or a dataframe we encounter an error:


```r
x <- c(0,0.05,0.3,0.4)

report_p(x)
```
```
Error in if (p < 0.001) { : the condition has length > 1
```

In R, conditional statements are not vector operations. They deal only with a single value. If you pass in, for example, a vector, the `if` statement will only check the very first element and issue a warning. The solution to this is the `ifelse()` or the tidyverse equivalent `if_else()` function

<div class="tab"><button class="tablinks= T active" onclick="javascript:openCode(event, 'option1= T', '= T');">Base R</button><button class="tablinks= T" onclick="javascript:openCode(event, 'option2= T', '= T');"><tt>tidyverse</tt></button></div><div id="option1= T" class="tabcontent= T">

             paste("p =", round(p, digits)))
     
     return(reported)
 }
```
</div><div id="option2= T" class="tabcontent= T">

```r
 report_p <- function(p, digits = 3) {

             paste("p =", round(p, digits)))
     
     return(reported)
 }
```
</div><script> javascript:hide('option2= T') </script>

## Warnings and errors

<div class="try">
<p>What happens when omit an argument for p, set the value to 1.5 or a
character “a”?</p>
</div>

Sometimes the function will not run, in the first example because we did not provide an argument default. 

For `p = 1.5` it probably *shouldn't* run (p = 1.5 makes no sense), but it does! 

For `p = "a"` there is a warning but perhaps not a very intuitive one. 

We can make our own custom/specific warnings, try this and run it with the arguments above again!
